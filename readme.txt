//To generate synthetic wind speed data

	1. use EmsSyntheticWind.cpp file
	2. Enable int main() function
	3. provide require values, name of the file with location path	//WindData

//To carry out simulation

	1. use EmsSimulation.cpp file
	2. follow the comments given inside the file



The simulation results of wind speeds 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5 m/s are stored in "Result" foler.
